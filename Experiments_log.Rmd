#### C. wallercreekii tubes:

  - Measurements
  - Inoculated tubes for transfer W
  - Reduced experiments to single replicates. Transferred replicate 1 with starting RF = 200. Preserved other replicates.
  
#### C. wallercreekii flasks:

  - Measurements
  - Decided not to extract RNA. Some growth curves look wonky. Cultures are also sparse, could use a couple more days before extracting.
  
#### C. cryptica tubes:

  - Measurements
  
#### C. cryptica flasks:

  - Measurements
  - No RNA extraction today. Some cultures are ready but delay due to filter holders.

  - Preserved with formalin C. cryptica transfer J.
  - Done with digestion of transfer G for C. cryptica. Rinsing and slides next.
