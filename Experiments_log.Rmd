#### C. wallercreekii tubes:
  - Measurements (KN)
  - Inoculated tubes for transfer W (KN)
  - Reduced experiments to single replicates. Transferred replicate 1 with starting RF = 200. Preserved other replicates. (TN)
  
#### C. wallercreekii flasks:
  - Measurements (TN)
  - Decided not to extract RNA. Some growth curves look wonky. Cultures are also sparse, could use a couple more days before extracting. (TN)
  
#### C. cryptica tubes:
  - Measurements (KN)
  
#### C. cryptica flasks:
  - Measurements (TN)
  - No RNA extraction today. Some cultures are ready but delay due to filter holders. (TN)
