### 2015-03-05
#### C. wallercreekii tubes:
  - Measurements (YL)
  
#### C. wallercreekii flasks:
  - Measurements (TN)
  - Some cultures wonky (as before). 
  - RNA extraction for:
      - 164-11 @ 2 - fine
      - 164-11 @ 12 - fine
      - 164-11 @ 36 - small pellet given density
      - 169-30 @ 24 - wouldn't pellet. No extraction.
  
#### C. cryptica tubes:
  - Measurements (YL)
  
#### C. cryptica flasks:
  - Measurements (TN)
  - Cultures look good. Starting to get dense. No filters yet, though. Wait another day before RNA extraction and/or transfer.

### 2015-03-04
#### C. wallercreekii tubes:
  - Measurements (KN)
  - Inoculated tubes for transfer W (KN)
  - Reduced experiment to single replicate. Transferred replicate 1 with starting RF = 200. Preserved other replicates. (TN)
  
#### C. wallercreekii flasks:
  - Measurements (TN)
  - Decided not to extract RNA. Some growth curves look wonky. Cultures are also sparse, could use a couple more days before extracting. (TN)
  
#### C. cryptica tubes:
  - Measurements (KN)
  
#### C. cryptica flasks:
  - Measurements (TN)
  - No RNA extraction today. Some cultures are ready but delay due to filter holders. (TN)
