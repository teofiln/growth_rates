### 2015-03-08
#### C. wallercreekii tubes:
  - Measurements (TN)
  
#### C. wallercreekii flasks:
  - One of interest 156-4 @ 36 is growing _very slowly_
  - Measurements (TN)
  
#### C. cryptica tubes:
  - Measurements (TN)

### 2015-03-07
#### C. wallercreekii tubes:
  - Measurements (TN)
  
#### C. wallercreekii flasks:
  - Two flasks left
  - One of interest 156-4 @ 36 is growing _very slowly_
  - Measurements (TN)
  
#### C. cryptica tubes:
  - Measurements (YL)
  - Transfer L: down to 200 RFU (YL)
  
#### C. cryptica flasks:
  - Measurements (TN)
  - RNA extraction (total=5): (TN)
      - 331 @ 0, 36
      - 332 @ 0, 36
      - 333 @ 36
    - Some of these < 10K RFU, so lower RNA concentration is expected

### 2015-03-06
#### C. wallercreekii tubes:
  - Measurements (KN)
  
#### C. wallercreekii flasks:
  - Two flasks left
  - One of interest 156-4 @ 36 is growing _very slowly_
  - Measurements (TN)
  
#### C. cryptica tubes:
  - Measurements (KN)
  
#### C. cryptica flasks:
  - Filter holders arrived 
  - Measurements 1 hour early to start RNA extraction earlier (TN)
  - Cultures look denser. Golden brown tinge. A bit of lawn in densest culture.
  - RNA extraction batch 1 (total=10): (TN)
      - 331 @ 2, 12, 24
      - 332 @ 2, 12, 24
      - 333 @ 2, 12
      - 1263 @ 2, 12
    - Filtering works OK. A bit tedious.
    - Concentrations high in comparison. Due to much denser cultures
    - Two RNA preps with concentration too high for Qubit HS assay. Need to measure dillutions.
  - RNA extraction batch 2 (total=5): (TN)
      - 333 @ 0, 24
      - 1263 @ 0, 24, 36
        - Extracted all that had RF > 10000

### 2015-03-05
#### C. wallercreekii tubes:
  - Measurements (YL)
  
#### C. wallercreekii flasks:
  - Measurements (TN)
  - Some cultures wonky (as before). 
  - RNA extraction for:
      - 164-11 @ 2 - fine
      - 164-11 @ 12 - fine
      - 164-11 @ 36 - small pellet given density
      - 169-30 @ 24 - wouldn't pellet. No extraction.
  
#### C. cryptica tubes:
  - Measurements (YL)
  
#### C. cryptica flasks:
  - Measurements (TN)
  - Cultures look good. Starting to get dense. No filters yet, though. Wait another day before RNA extraction and/or transfer.

### 2015-03-04
#### C. wallercreekii tubes:
  - Measurements (KN)
  - Inoculated tubes for transfer W (KN)
  - Reduced experiment to single replicate. Transferred replicate 1 with starting RF = 200. Preserved other replicates. (TN)
  
#### C. wallercreekii flasks:
  - Measurements (TN)
  - Decided not to extract RNA. Some growth curves look wonky. Cultures are also sparse, could use a couple more days before extracting. (TN)
  
#### C. cryptica tubes:
  - Measurements (KN)
  
#### C. cryptica flasks:
  - Measurements (TN)
  - No RNA extraction today. Some cultures are ready but delay due to filter holders. (TN)
